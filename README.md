## Hey! I'm Montaga 👋



### Thanks for visiting my Github profile! ###

🌱 I am currently finishing the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at the Codaisseur academy in Amsterdam. Programming has quickly become one of my biggest passions, it brings me great joy to be able to turn my ideas into projects and tools that can be useful for others. You can check out Slacker, one of my latest projects, which for now is a web app that allows you to create film lists and add reviews for the films and shows that you love. Soon I'm hoping to turn it into a social platform for film buffs.

### Hey! I'm Montaga ðŸ‘‹



#### Thanks for visiting my Github profile! ####

ðŸŒ± I am currently finishing the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at the Codaisseur academy in Amsterdam. Programming has quickly become one of my biggest passions, it brings me sheer joy to be able to turn my ideas into projects and tools that can be useful for others.  
This is a very exciting journey for me and I'm looking forward to continuing to build some exciting and challenging projects.
